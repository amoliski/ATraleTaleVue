        They’ve always been there, peacefully looming over the small hidden towns I’ve been lucky enough to call home—imprinting their ever-changing shadows into the ancient, river-filled valleys.
      </p>
      <p>
        The endless green aisle has blanketed my life in the comfortable closeness of dark forests, gifting me the great familiarity of home only those who dwell within can truly understand and appreciate.
        The Appalachians have calmly steered my destiny for 25 years, and in that time I’ve never lived outside their corridors of influence.

      <p>
        Stretching from Georgia to Maine, the mountains, my mountains have a single through-line, an omnipresent artery that quietly runs 2,100 miles through conifers, concrete, and culture alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        A trail as old as the country, hidden in a range as old as time has called me for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve heard the siren song of the Appalachian Trail, for its path cuts not two hours from where I was raised.
        And as I’ve grown, the beckoning right in my backyard has only boomed, and it’s melody will not leave my ears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its not a choice, really. I must go. I must retrace my roots as I explore a historical
        trail that cuts through the fabric of the very country it rests. It's time I’ve fully explored my backyard.
